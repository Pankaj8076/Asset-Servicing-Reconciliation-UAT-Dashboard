📄 Asset Servicing Reconciliation & UAT Dashboard

A Business Analysis & Data Reconciliation Project by Pankaj H. Chavan

✅ Project Overview

This project focuses on reconciling asset servicing data between a legacy platform and a new target system, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and data integrity during a system migration. Using Advanced Excel, Power Query, and structured UAT processes, I built a reconciliation framework and UAT dashboard to identify mismatches, track defect resolution, and improve reliability before production deployment.

The project applies core Business Analyst and Data Analyst practices including requirement understanding, data validation, stakeholder communication, root-cause analysis, and documentation.

✅ Objectives

Compare and validate transactional data between Legacy System A and Target System B

Identify mismatches, breaks, and incomplete records

Build a dynamic Excel/Power Query reconciliation model

Improve data match accuracy and reduce manual effort

Create a UAT Test Tracker Dashboard for test cycle monitoring

Support stakeholders with transparent reporting and issue management

✅ Key Features of the Project
🔍 1. Automated Data Reconciliation Model

Loaded datasets from two systems

Cleaned and standardized fields (trimming, null checks, data type fixes)

Performed reconciliations using:

VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP

Conditional match rules

Multi-key matching logic

Power Query merges

📊 2. Mismatch Identification & Root Cause Analysis

Detected missing records

Found incorrect mappings, outdated IDs, and amount variances

Classified mismatches into categories:

Data quality issues

Mapping errors

System extraction issues

Business rule exceptions

✅ 3. UAT Dashboard (Excel / Power Query)

The dashboard included:

Test cases by module

Passed/Failed counts

Severity distribution

Defect aging

Pending items for approval

Remarks & responsible team labels

📄 4. Stakeholder Reporting Pack

Prepared structured outputs for:

Operations

Product/Tech

QA/UAT teams

Management

Reports included:

Daily reconciliation breaks

Summary tables

Exception logs

UAT progress trackers

Final sign-off document
